## 🤔 What this is

The personal portfolio of **ZERB (Zerb Lion)** — motion design, visual art, and code under one roof. It began as a WordPress export and was rebuilt from scratch into a fast, motion-first **Astro** site, organized around three pillars:

- **Motion** — systems of movement, interfaces that breathe.
- **Visual** — worlds, surfaces and light.
- **Code** — things built, not just designed.

Instead of a stiff nav-and-short-pages layout, it's one long, scroll-driven page with anchored sections — plus an **"AI Ask"** panel that answers questions about any project, the process, or how to get in touch.

## ✨ Highlights

- 🎬 **Motion-first** — Lenis smooth scroll + GSAP, a per-line hero intro (mask-wipe / blur / typewriter), a difference-blend custom cursor with contextual labels, and cursor-magnet accent dots.
- 🤖 **Ask AI** — a slide-in assistant that streams from a multi-provider endpoint (Gemini → OpenAI → Claude), grounded in a knowledge base compiled from the project content. Rate-limited and quota-guarded.
- 🖼 **Image-forward grid** — featured-first pillar sections; covers rest under a neutral veil and resolve to full colour on hover (desktop), stay bright on touch.
- 🎞 **R2-hosted video** — heavy media lives on Cloudflare R2 (free egress), kept out of Git.
- 🔤 **Self-hosted fonts** — Montserrat (display) + Mulish (body), preloaded, no FOUT, no China-blocked Google Fonts.
- ⚡ **Astro + View Transitions** — static-fast pages, with the header / cursor / AI panel persisted across navigations.

## 🧭 Stack

```
Astro 6  +  Tailwind v4          →  the site            (app/)
GSAP  +  Lenis                   →  motion & smooth scroll
/api/chat  (serverless)          →  multi-provider AI, streamed
Cloudflare R2                    →  video hosting
Vercel  (root: app/)             →  deploy  ·  zerb.net
```

The repo also keeps the original **WordPress static export** at the root for reference — the live site is the Astro rebuild in `app/`.

## 🚀 Run it locally

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:4321
```

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # add a GEMINI_API_KEY (or OpenAI / Anthropic) for the AI panel
npm run build          # production build
```

> Media + AI keys live in `.env` (gitignored). The Ask AI panel degrades gracefully without a key.

## 🗺 Roadmap

- [ ] Reliable mainland-China delivery for media (CDN / mirror)
- [ ] Hi-res covers for the Motion pillar
- [ ] More work in the Code pillar
- [ ] Cross-instance AI rate-limiting via Upstash
